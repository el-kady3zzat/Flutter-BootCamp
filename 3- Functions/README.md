# Find Minimum Number in a List

This Dart program finds the smallest number in a list of integers using different loop approaches.

## Features
- **Input**: A predefined list of integers (e.g., `[1, 5, 3, 10, 50, -2, 130, 24]`).
- **Processing**:
  - Iterates through the list using a loop to determine the smallest number.
  - Demonstrates three different approaches: `for` loop, `for-in` loop, and `forEach` loop (only one active at a time).
- **Output**: Prints the original list and the minimum number found.

## Code Structure
- **`minimumNumber`**:
  - A function that accepts a list of integers.
  - Iterates through the list and updates a variable (`mini`) to store the smallest number.
  - The active loop is currently a `forEach` loop.

## Example Output
For the list `[1, 5, 3, 10, 50, -2, 130, 24]`, the program prints:

## Highlights
- Demonstrates multiple loop styles in Dart for finding the minimum value.
- Clean and reusable function for processing numeric lists.
